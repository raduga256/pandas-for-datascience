# pandas-for-datascience
For most of my panda related learning and projects
In this Repository I will focus on how to walk through many of the fundamental concepts to use the Python Pandas Data Science Library
We start off by installing pandas and loading in an example csv. We then look at different ways to read the data.
Read a column, rows, specific cell, etc. Also ways to read data based on conditioning. 
We then move into some more advanced ways to sort & filter data. We look at making conditional changes to our data. 
We also start doing aggregate stats using the groupby function. 
We also load very large data set into python by chunks
